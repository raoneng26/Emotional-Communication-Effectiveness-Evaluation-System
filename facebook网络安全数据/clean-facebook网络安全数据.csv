We are paying for ourselves, of course, but Stephen is trying to raise his share of the costs.
He has done a lot for Otago sport and he has helped us a lot over the years on the radio, especially when I was at the Edge, he used to stand for HOURS all day, everyday, outside our Jingle Bail cell and collect money for deserving kids to go on their own trip of a lifetime.

Do you want to help Stephen with his birthday wish? It would mean a lot to both of us.

Bill Bullerwell;"The left have weaponized the Courts and exploited the Constitution to empower the minority, weaken the middle class and disenfranchise the majority in this Country. Communist ideas are now being shoe-horned in under the guise of ‚Äúclimate change action‚Äù, ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù or a fake facade of ‚Äúcivil liberties‚Äù.

We are in a battle right now. It‚Äôs good vs evil now. Right vs wrong. Absurdity vs common sense. Constitutional freedoms vs Global authoritarianis
m by unelected, self-appointed elitists. National sovereignty vs globalism.
Leftwing leaders all across the world are onboard with an authoritarian WEF/WHO/UN global agenda, also known as the Great Global Reset! Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt ‚ÄúRESET‚Äù something that isn‚Äôt broken first. This is why they are intentionally doing everything in their power to break the western world, including BANKRUPTING the middle-class in this Country. Their stated intentions are to ‚Äúreset us morally, socially, politically, economically and spiritually‚Äù. This is what is coming folks. TIME TO WAKE UP!!!!!

Increased constraints on the farming industry and food production, more engineered inflation and levels of poverty, more online censorship and digital control, more supply-chain constraints on all commodities, continued attacks on gun ownership Rights, continued massive floods of undocumented immigration, more fraudulent election interference. Citizens must prepare for mass-surveillan
ce, less individual Rights and Freedoms, increase in crime rates and social disorder. You will also see an increase in psychological ware-fare like behaviour modification tactics, social conditioning and propaganda campaigns.
‚ÄúWe are reaching a point where the only way of saving the planet is for the industrial civilized world to collapse. Isn‚Äôt it up to us to ensure this happens?‚Äù
-Maurice Strong. (SG-United Nations and WEF co-founder).

#1 POVERTY- Increase taxes/Increase poverty levels. Poor people are easier to control and will keep socialists in power if they are providing for them.
#2 DEBT- Continually Increase debt to unsustainable levels. This produces more poverty, destroying businesses, bankrupting individuals and will inevitably remove private property rights for the vast majority of citizens eventually.
#3 WELFARE- Take control of all aspects of a person‚Äôs life, forcing them to be accountable to government. (Food, housing, income...etc)
#4 FOOD- Take control of food production, farming industry, food distribution. Hungry people are easy to control.
#5 HEALTH CARE- A federally controlled healthcare directive helps to promote and encourage a social state. Control healthcare and you control the people.
#6 EDUCATION- Brainwash children by indoctrinating them with leftist ideas at our expense, inside our own tax-funded school systems.
#7 MEDIA- Control all aspects of information. Weaponize the news media to control what information people receive. Bought-out media and government sponsored propaganda campaigns can be used as psychological warfare. (Subversion/
social conditioning/
behaviour modification).
#8 RELIGION- Remove the belief and concept of God from public schools and government institutions. Force people to be accountable to government, NOT God. Destroy traditional values by attacking the family unit, social norms and Biblical principle‚Äôs. Encourage promiscuity and sexual perversion. Promote social causes that are in direct conflict to Christian/
western beliefs and values.
#9 CLASS WARFARE- Divide people into three basic groups based on gender/sexual orientation, race and financial class (wealthy vs poor). Increase contempt for the middle-class and wealthy with the support from the poor. Separate people into groups to promote discord and disunity to gain support from the majority of the poor to over-tax the rich and destroy capitalism.
#10 GUN CONTROL- Remove the ability for citizens to defend themselves against an ever-increasing
authoritarian government. Create a police state!";2024-05-22T23:39:00;;;;;;2024-05-23T12:15:46;https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0HjFrM1YfjkoCuJosRnvaFwdjewhhuhZWc7rAeepVSnoXX5r8cjjSNfLWesCaXnq9l&id=100047112765345;Sean Hannity;64;92;31;San Diego is now the #1 sector on southern border for illegal entry - with immigrants pouring in from Iran, China and Pakistan.;Sean Hannity;;0

Miles de Priest;"China picking a war against Taiwan will only increase the economy of the West but destroy the Chinese long-term investment. China is already struggling and I don't think it will be reasonable to pick a war against anyone.
If China pick a war, their merchant vessels will be stacked up for a very long time.
Imagine causing the displacement of 1.4 bn people.
This was how Hong Kong and Taiwan were born and another war will further split China..

Pat Mc Ginley;"Humanity's enemy isn't Russia, China, Iran or North Korea, etc. It is the corporate-contr
olled US. Driven by insatiable greed and with 800+ military installations in 140+ countries worldwide, the corporate-contr
olled US Empire has a shameful history of toppling elected presidents who can't be bought. Empires never settle for anything less than total ownership and control of the world's natural, human and financial resources. This makes the US the main instigator of wars and terrorism worldwide. Humanity urgently needs real democracy in the corporate-contr
olled U.S., fraudulently disguised as 'democracy'. The 20 year-long Princeton University research in 2014 revealed/
confirmed the US is not a democracy or a republic. It's corporate-contr

Frank Zain;"Breaking news.. the war criminal Khalifa Haftar brought Russia, Wagner criminal company, America's first enemy and Europe to Libya for eliminating the interests and dreams of America and Europe in Africa and threaten Europe‚Äôs security by illegal immigration and cutting off gas and oil. He is now running for presidency, and the bodies of women and children are still being exhumed from mass graves in the city of Tarhuna. What is happening in Libya is a disgrace on global democracy. He and his sons are also behind what is happening today in Sudan, Burkina Faso, Mali, Central African Republic and Niger.. The stay of the war criminal Khalifa Haftar in Libya is a continuation of destabilization
Africa and the entire region, and a threat to international peace and security.

Julian Tirazona;"U.S. are losing their dominant position, they have lost it economically, and they're losing it politically and in many ways. It is as it say, the last bite of a dying snake, it's the most venomous and most poisonous.

The U.S. is doing everything they can to contain the development of China. It has engaged in wars on trade, diplomacy, and finance against China, but all end up in vain. The only card they can play right now is the Taiwan and South China Sea card, because the international community knows that the Chinese mainland regards people in Taiwan as compatriots.

One of the big worries is that the people of Taiwan are not being well educated by their leaders on how dangerous the situation in Taiwan can be and how in this very rough and dangerous games of geopolitics and National geopolitics in some ways it's like a game of chess .
In a game of chess you easily sacrifice a pawn, if it gives you an advantage, Taiwan is a pawn and Taiwan can be sacrificed. And the people of Taiwan must get to know this because if they don't they'll be sacrificed. And so at the end of the day the best thing we can do on Taiwan is to preserve the status quo. But as you can see with the visits by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, there are some forces who want to create trouble across Taiwan Straits. And even Thomas L. Friedman of New York Times described her visit as dangerous, reckless, and irresponsible. So the Taiwan question is a dangerous issue and that could start a conflict.";2024-05-22T21:00:00;;;;;;2024-05-23T09:54:49;https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid024orc55f1qK4po9PY2FYNuwYqi5g43HvemV5DGEQsZUFoo8b34n1kAxwonA8bo13kl&id=100064391875569;CNA;58;55;3;"The announcement of the new trilateral summit came a day after Beijing reportedly summoned South Korean and Japanese diplomats to discuss ""issues about Taiwan"".";CNA;;0

Steve Dutton;No it's not, it happens to all players. I remember when Hoddle first dropped Gazza, it was a very hard decision and it didn't go down well with the fans, but it was his time. Just like Ronaldo has had his time. Think back to Luis Figo, nobody could imagine a Portugal side without him, he was Portugal, but players have to be dropped to make way for new players. When Ronaldo moved away to make money, that was it, he's not playing top football anymore and tonight's game proved that, it's gone past his time. The Portugal manager needs to grow a pair;2024-06-18T21:00:00;;;;;;2024-06-19T05:48:29;https://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid02ZkDFEup1QCtMyLJWgf3UnogYU4ZtByKPf5qRrixQdwBjwUtmTx9D4dVYdnomVwHKl&id=100064707219488;Mirror Football;140;3900;22;"""It's tough to drop a player with 130 international goals and five Ballon d‚ÄôOr trophies - even if he is just seven months shy of his 40th birthday"" üó£";Mirror Football;;0

Marvin Low;"Conventional or nuclear war is cruel and costly to world trade and security, and once is started it will be difficult to silent the sound of shelling, gunfire, missiles, planes, and prevent the destruction to infrastructures
, plants, environment, warships, submarines and fighter jets, displacement of people, and the killing and suffering of animals, soldiers, sailors, pilots and civilians.

Look at what happens to Ukraine now, a small nation (funded by US taxpayers and US led Nato members) involved in a conflict with a bigger and stronger neighbouring Russia. The world feels sorry for the suffering and displacement of Ukrainian people, running away from their homeland to seek shelter in other parts of Europe as refugees!
In addition we all know that the more you engage in conflict or war, the poorer and the more desperate you become!!

As Taiwan is a Chinese province, a war over Taiwan is not in China‚Äôs interest (Chinese killing Chinese). However, dialogue, negotiation, and collaboration are an effective way for both of them to come together in a peaceful reunification process and thus preventing war in Asia Pacific region. However, China has reiterated on countless occasions that it will take military action if Taiwan crosses Beijing's red lines and makes a move towards independence. In short, Chinas‚Äô actions are all about safeguarding Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, development and core interests. The use of force is to guard against external interference from the US and its eastern and western allies, all secessionists' activities and is not targeting Chinese in Taiwan island.

The PLA is the world's largest military in terms of personnel, and its modernisation is progressing smoothly and speedily. A sea blockage by China will cause chaos and panic to the small island and Taiwan remains massively outgunned by China. The PLA is adding hundreds of new fighter jets, submarines and warships every year. Fighting at the backyard (Taiwan Strait, South China Sea and East China Sea), PLA will have overwhelming military strength in depth and advantage over the US and its allies in terms of troop numbers, quick mobilisation of its formidable air, land and naval forces, massively well-protected airspace, blockade of Taiwan and Spratly Islands capability, ballistic missile submarines, warships, hypersonic missiles and conventional arms and weapons at its disposal!!.

Many foreign military strategists and analysts fear that If the US and its allies interfere in the Chinese peaceful reunification process, not only will the US lose its nuclear-powered
aircraft carriers, it will lose all of its military bases in the Asia-Pacific region, such as Japan, Philippines, Guam and even Australia if the military conflict breaks out.
